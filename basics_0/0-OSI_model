The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.

OSI Model Layers:

7. Application Layer
   - Protocols: FTP, HTTP, SMTP
   - Network process to application

6. Presentation Layer
   - Formats: Jpeg, Mpeg, Gif
   - Data representation & encryption

5. Session Layer
   - Protocols: AppleTalk
   - Interhost communication

4. Transport Layer
   - Protocols: TCP, UDP
   - End-to-end connections & reliability

3. Network Layer
   - Protocols: IP, IPX, ICMP
   - Path determination & logical addressing

2. Data Link Layer
   - Protocols: PPP, Ethernet
   - Physical addressing

1. Physical Layer
   - Technologies: Ethernet, USB
   - Media signal & binary transmission
